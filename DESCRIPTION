Description: The MSARM package provides tools to estimate Markov-Switching AR models 
  with arbitrary parameter switching using the EM algorithm. The core functions include 
  'MSARM.fit' for estimation, 'MSARM.predict' for forecasting, and 'MSARM.plot' for 
  visualization. The implementation closely follows the theory of Hamilton (1990, 1994) 
  and the methods described in Müller (2025), "From Theory to Application: Developing MSARM".
  Only AR models are currently supported. ADL, VAR, or VECM models are not implemented.
  Users can customize EM settings, including iteration count, number of random starting points,
  and the selection criterion. The package also provides regime probabilities, in-sample fits,
  and supports bootstrap forecasts with confidence intervals.
